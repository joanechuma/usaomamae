                            <p> gpg, by default, compresses all encrypted data with zlib – to be more specific: zlib level 6 – which is similar to gzip. i recommend trying gunzip or gpg with the right key to decompress the file. please let me know weather this works or not. thanks. I’ve already had a broken bottle of bleach spray fall on my head from the top shelf in the bathroom. Ruining a brand new shirt. Not only that, it was all in my hair. Had to get it out somehow, right? Well I got to wash my long hair in the sink with hand soap and dry with paper towels. Needless to say, my hair is looking like a birds nest. To top it off, there is a brown recluse running around GnuPG expects keys to be imported to the keychain, so gpg --import key-file it first. There are hacks using --keyring your-key-file , but simply importing the key file is the safer way to go. For scripted/programmed operations, best practice is to always denote the full fingerprint. Huge thanks to many people in the community who helped make this possible, especially the developers and those that helped pay for the security audit. I'm sure some folks have questions, so please consider this post an AMA! :) Once again thanks and congrats to the entire BCH community on this huge milestone. As usual, only download from https://electroncash.org and verify the checksum before running. The only way to use a specific public key file like a keyring is if the file is in the GPG (OpenPGP) file format and not an ASCII armoured version (e.g. pubkey.gpg not pubkey.asc). Hi all, I've searched high and low and could not find the solution to this problem, and I'm hoping someone here can help. I have a Windows 10 64-bit Version 1803 installed. I have 16gb or RAM installed on the machine. Thunderbird is version 60.5.0 (32-bit) and Enigmail is version 2.0.9 (20181209-1409). I also have gpg4win version 3.1.5 and gpg is version 2.2.11. From what I can tell, everything is on the latest version and up-to-date. I've only recently noticed this behavior, where We explain what GPG files are and recommend software that we know can open or convert your GPG files. What is a GPG file? The .gpg file extension is used for an encrypted file format that was created by Free Software Foundation 
Gpg4win supports both relevant cryptography standards, OpenPGP and S/MIME (X.509), and is the official GnuPG distribution for Windows. It is maintained by the developers of GnuPG. Gpg4win Small sized GPG command-line tool for Windows. . Where can I find a command-line version of GPG for Windows? It should be small size because Gpg4win Light Hi I'm using a service called hashtab to verify checksums on downloaded software for windows. It's super easy and simple. It would be nice if you did not require people to download an entire separate software package for windows GPG just to open the checksum file. If you were to try hashtab you would find it much more user friendly. Please consider this would be better for MyCrypto and Windows users. How to Batch Decrypt With GNU GPG. One question frequently asked in GPG news groups is "How do I decrypt more than one file at a time?" Make sure you have a working GNU GPG installation. I understand that two of the greatest obstacles to making sexy interfaces for GPG is that it handles sensitive data which must be handled very carefully, and that it's frequently used to secure text and attachments in communications channels that are doubly difficult to securely integrate with. (the third is key trust and distribution, but I won't pretend to offer anything new there lol!) But some of GPG's features like verifying a file's signature (whether attached or detached) against Setting up GPG on Windows. August 23, 2017 Torleif Leave a comment. What I did to get from zero to a good working (hopefully) secure 
Hi, When I try to update the Emacs packages, I got this message. ``` Failed to verify signature archive-contents.sig: Bad signature from 474F05837FBDEF9B GNU ELPA Signing Agent ltelpasign@elpa.gnu.orggt Command output: gpg: Signature made 02/25/19 06:10:02 China Standard Time gpg: using DSA key CA442C00F91774F17F59D9B0474F05837FBDEF9B gpg: BAD signature from "GNU ELPA Signing Agent ltelpasign@elpa.gnu.orggt" unknown ``` I check my local GPG toolset I'm not sure if the Windows 10 mail application support plugins. I also haven't heard of any. One solution is to do the encryption manually. Create your message, encrypt it using GPG, then use the Win10 mail program to send the message. Windows can check the integrity and the publisher of a signed software package. Method A: UAC. When trying to run the installer on Windows, the User Access Control dialog will show the publisher, check that is the one you expected it to be. :) (If you have disabled User Access Control use a different method.). Using electrum 3.1.3 and I cannot connect to a server to send coins. I’ve tried multiple servers and it either give me red orb or arrows. I figured I should update it to latest version but I got completely lost and couldn’t figure it out. I was following a guide someone had posted on here but I got as far as trying to run the new program and couldn’t get that to work. I am a noob so don’t hate too much but any help would be appreciated. Just trying to get my coins out of this wallet. I would like to have opinions about qubes from those who use it as a main os. What feature/workflow make you stick with qubes ? Do you sometime miss features ? Do you sometime miss another os and why ? amp#x200B. Entire electrum wallet is a scam now? I can no longer sync to the network using an old client and when i go to electrum.org (https://electrum.org) and download the windows standalone exe it doesn't check out. amp#x200B; gpg: Signature made 02/13/19 23:08:29 W.

I would like to try Linux Mint 19 on my desktop but want to be sure that what i downloaded is authentic before run it on my PC. Do anyone knows about a third-party software that can help me with this or is there a built-in program that windows has for this? PD: Tried to google it, but didn't found what i was looking. 
Appreciate feedback on hardware as well as software. Thanks. Hey everybody! I'm the proud new owner of a YubiKey 5C, bought with the intent of using it with a password manager. amp#x200B; I've been using PasswordSafe for the past several years, with copies of the psafe3 file synced up via a separate cloud storage account across Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android devices. It's worked well enough, but I'm open to switching. amp#x200B; While PasswordSafe indicates that it supports YubiKey on Android, I was disappointed to find out after trying Krita 4.1.3 just got released! There are both new features and a load of bug fixes! Read all about it here: https://krita.org/en/item/krita-4-1-3-released/ (And don't forget about our fundraiser. We want to fix more bugs!). 
Ok so basically I keep hearing about Tor being a great browser, but since I had a problem with it being refused by my proxy, I downloaded the Tor app. Is it legitimate I am trying to replace my SSH keys with a PGP key. This means I always need gpg\-agent to be running to in order to use it as an SSH agent. However, "gpg\-agent \-\-daemon" doesn't work at all on Windows as far as I can tell. How do I run this program in the background and at launch? "START /B gpg\-agent" doesn't seem to work either. EDIT (2018\-06\-09T15:51:03\+01:00): So after some research, I found that the \-\-daemon argument isn't implemented at all for Windows (https://dev.gnupg.org/T. We need a way to verify the checksum on linux, gpg sig and checksums for the download. come on this is obvious we our talking about your product being our bank and you dont know to have this option available? This is a must have. No questions just get it done for us please. I can't find the .asc files for Firefox 60.0 nor 60.0.1 on official FTP server any longer. As example for 59.0.3 win64 EME-free it exist: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/59.0.3/win64-EME-free/de/ But not for 60.0 nor the new 60.0.1: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/60.0.1/win64-EME-free/de/ All languages are affected and all windows versions, no matter if EME-free I've been searching Google for a few days and surprised I haven't found anything yet. Ultimately I'm trying to find something that will encrypt files client side using a gpg/pgp public key, before uploading anything to a server. Pre-programmable host information would be a plus. Any suggestions? Something you'd tell your grandmother to use. ^Also ^if ^there's ^a ^better ^sub ^to ^ask ^in, ^let ^me ^know. ~~Hi, this is a warning for everyone using this wallet right now.~~ Electrum is safe I was just hacked on my windows 10 pc and more than 5 bitcoin were stolen. I have no idea how this could happen and I am really in shock. The most sad thing about it, I was trying to sweep the funds from a paper wallet and send those to a ledger nano S. What I did: Installed electrum wallet for Windows (electrum-2.9.3-setup.exe) from https://electrum.org/#download. I checked the md5sum So I downloaded GPG Keychain on my Mac, tried encrypting my messages, it worked great, I could even decrypt my own messages which proves that it works, however the problem \ starts\ when receiving \ incoming\ messages that are encrypted from \ \ other people\ \ , so when I go on to GPG Keychain, I am unable to decrypt the messages I receive from others, even \ \ after\ \ importing their public keys and verifying the person and even after giving them my public key, I am \ \ still\ \ unable. </p>
