Hi, got this CD for Christmas and itunes keeps on downloading the censored version. No where on the case i can see it say censored but it also doesn't say explicit either. Any help? Is Itunes being fucky or did I just get the lame edition. Thanks. Antennas to Hell; Сборник Slipknot; Дата выпуска: 23 июля 2012 года: Жанры: ню-метал альтернативный метал. I am a pretty big fan of Slipknot, but I gotta say, isn't a greatest hits album after only 4 albums a little pointless? Their promotional videos have been pretty cool though, in the way Sid remixes some of their songs.

I haven't been able to really figure out what the initial idea was for this album. (not the recording covers idea) Is it just a BEST OF SLIPKNOT album that we decide what songs make it on the compilation? We design artwork and all that for it? Maybe I'm just old and out of the loop, but what's the point? Antennas to Hell will pretty much mirror whatever songs we vote to make it on the album. I'd hope at least a couple less popular songs would make it on there. I DO like the idea of mixing. Скачать альбом Slipknot - Antennas To Hell в формате mp3.
