I've been looking through most of the preview videos and LPs, and although all make a mention of the Avatar Project, I haven't really caught any information regarding the time scale of the whole process. Has anyone any idea as to how long it would actually last in-game (assuming a lack of XCOM interference)? Also, I'm not sure if it's changed, but is its completion an insta-win for the aliens? I vaguely recall Jake Solomon saying it was one of a few conditions, but in one of the videos

There are 3 ways it could increase. First, dark events which could be countered. Second is black sites which again could be countered. Finally the main facility itself which has no counter except story missions to reduce the progress. As we know, once we hit all red bars the game gives you a timer. However, any reduction in red bars during this period would reset the timer. We know that assaulting blacksites removes all red bar progresses. 6 сен 2017  Ближе к финалу партии в XCOM 2 ваш корабль «Мститель»  позволяет тормозить проект «Аватар» как действиями в самой игре, так.

Hi, I've seen a few people say that the avatar timer resets when you hit a base, and that you should ONLY attack an alien facility when the timer is full. Am I understanding this? Wait for the timer to fill up all the way and only then attack? Thanks. Based on - the mission goal in operation „War Hand“ (Download Atmospheric Analysis from exposed access point) - the connection between the vial and the abducted people in operation „Ice Queen“ (Investigate the Advent Blacksite) - the yellowish mist surrounding the alien facility in Firaxis’s „Let’s Play XCOM 2 - PSI Op“ I think the aliens are changing the composition of the atmosphere or maybe releasing something into it (a virus, nanomachines, …).

Welcome back to my monthly report! A scattered month for me, but I did make some good progress. My PC situation still isn't settled, since a PC repair shop led me to believe something could be done about my busted laptop before eventually giving up. I'm making do with an ancient laptop for the time being, but almost all my gaming time has been on PS4. Finished games XCOM 2: War of the Chosen (PS4) Playtime: No idea, probably close to the 50 hours average listed Game happens in a merged timeline- Earth has either upgraded (Xcom EU/EW) or rebuilt (Xcom 2) itself with alien technology Bradford is a cyborg and/or in a wheelchair, still wants to kill ALL THE ALIENS Vahlen and Tygan are at opposite ends of the science lab, being passive-aggressive at each other and trying to make the commander choose with them/their projects Lily Shen is the engineer and has some distinguishing features this time We hear literally nothing about the WOTC Faction. I’ve been binging on WotC lately, and I don’t have any other friends who play XCOM, so I thought I’d share a story about one of the most harrowing missions I’ve ever done. I’m playing on Commander Ironman mode, and for the most part I feel like I’ve been doing well (I had some problems with the game crashing earlier, but that seems to have been fixed). Yet despite not losing a single mission, the Avatar Project progress bar filled up, giving me 2 weeks to lower it or lose the game. There Well, I finally did it: after a long series of failures and one ragequit, I finally conquered L/I (vanilla WOTC, no other expansions). Here's the proof: https://imgur.com/gallery/LVwkhfX As you can see, it was a crazy ride, and nowhere near optimal. I teetered on the brink of failure a couple of times. - On one guerrilla mission, I was obliged to rush the objective inside a building by sneaking past one pod rather than engaging it. I was doing fine. until that first pod patrolled 
Hey guys. I have a serious gamebreaking bug. I skulljacked a codex (maybe the clone of a codex?) and the avatar spawned, I killed him and have his shadow chamber project ready to research; but it says I have to research some things before doing his research. I have done everything in the story up to the point where I have to research his corpse. I have done the blacksite vial and the two codex brain missions. I still have the skulljack a codex mission active and when I get close enough I started up a game again after messing around with my character pool, eliminating all of my solder characters and leaving just the faction characters (plus SPARKS) and customising soldiers as I go to suit their Bondings, and maybe even pick up one or two trophies since I have it on my PS4. Had two advanced options, the extended avatar project and the persistant Dark events. It was a massive uphill climb for resources, I had so much locked away because i was always in need of supplies or alloy. The difference between Commander and Legendary difficulty in XCOM 2(WOTC) is insane! On C/I I literally can abuse the game to the point of ridiculousness, I can trigger 3 elite spectres, a beserker, shieldbearer, and two troopers at once and literally not even care cause my soldiers are so broken The avatar project is not happening anytime soon, i just use covert actions to reduce it along with occasional facility assault, easy 9 aliens alfa striked. The chosen are XP farms, nothing I'm by no means an expert and I failed multiple times before succeeding, the below is what I did that made my run succeed as opposed to all my other attempts. Lessons from failed attempts: Once you fall behind on the power curve, getting back is extremely hard. Power curve includes tech and squad experience. Chosen Avenger defense is not that hard but leaves large part of your roster tired and will affect you negatively for a long time. Chosen showing up at the wrong </p>
