                            <p>I have a Windows PC at work with 4 x 4TB non-boot volume drives setup in RAID1, although there was only one Drive E: that accessed them. The “the drive” failed. I took them out and hooked them up to another PC via a SATA-to-USB cable but couldn’t read them. One of the 4 drives gave a dialogue box saying I have to format it to read it, the same message that indicated the failure when they were in the original PC. And the other 3 drives just don’t get recognized, although a “Driver Software Instal. Hi All Hope some of you have suggestions here. Have a mdadm raid with 11 disks. After the server has been closed down and started back up - 4 disks was missing in mdadm og the other 7 was set to S. I have managed to assemble/recover the raid with all disks. But with messed up superblocks and I am not able to find the partition. I have tried to find the partition with testdisk and seems to be out of luck. When trying to run a filesys check I am getting an error: e2fsck: Bad magic number. A few days I messed up the file system of an external hard drive of mine somehow (most likely through the Boot-repair live usb). Ntfsfix gave the following: gtMounting volume. ntfs_mst_post_read_fixup_warn: magic: 0x24738cd6 size: 1024 usa_ofs: 8316 usa_count: 45321: Invalid argument gtRecord 0 has no FILE magic (0x24738cd6) gtFailed to load $MFT: Input/output error gtFAILED gtAttempting to correct errors. ntfs_mst_post_read_fixup_warn: magic: 0x24738cd6 size: Allow me to explain my case, I have a new laptop with one 512GB SSD which I decided to set up for dual boot: Partitions 1-4 are all Windows related Partitions totaling a little over 100GB of drive space Partition 5 is a "Cross-OS" NTFS volume of 200GB which I want to use to be the main storage of all my important documents, media files, project files, etc. Partition 6 using the remaining drive space is my Linux partition (currently Fedora 29) which is where Hey r/techsupport! I've been trying to help a friend recover a non-working pc that wasn't even backed up. I managed to get a data backup via testdisk, and as of now if I connect the HDD to my own laptop I can see all three partitions and I could copy his stuff over. After finishing the copy, I put his drive back in the laptop thinking everything would work but that wasn't the case, I was getting a "Missing Operating System" at startup (which iirc is the same error he was getting before giving. My computer started doing some really weird stuff yesterday. I had been trying to extract audio from an old album I bought years ago using EAC. The disc was throwing read errors all over the place, but many of them EAC was able to recover from with its strategy of "keep retrying the sector in the hopes that it'll magically work". But then suddenly the drive hung, EAC just sat there at exactly the same sector without read success or failure for, I dunno, probably 30 minutes whilst I did other. 
This has been an exciting 30 minutes to say the least. It all started with me wanting to update my BIOS. I could only manage to find a 128 GB USB drive so Windows won't let me format it as FAT32. So what do you do? DISKPART! I'm no stranger to diskpart and I'm well aware of the dangers of using it but I still managed to fuck it up. I have 3 hard drives connected to my PC so it lists 4 disks in diskpart. My USB drive is the 3rd one on the list so without thinking twice I type "select So I have a raspberry pi that I use to host my plex media server amongst other things. Recently something happened to the Pi and I had to reformat it's SD card. Once the device was back up and running I started rebuilding it's configuration and came to a grinding halt when I got the the mounting of the hard drive. It says "/dev/sda1 not found." I blink and type in fdisk -l again and sure enough I see: gt gt Disk /dev/sda: 1.8 TiB, 2000398934016 bytes, 3907029168 sectors gt Units: sectors. I wasn't thinking and did a read/write benchmark using Crystaldiskmark on my Windows partition to my linux partition. On this pic (https://i.imgur.com/TmquRmA.png), bottom part is what a default Ubuntu install looks like using the encrypted option. Above is what it looks like with the same install options. It took a while to think of what might've caused this but I think it was the benchmark and not an ssd failure as everything else indicates it's ok. Upon boot I had an error "failed to conne. 
I used to have a dual-boot system (win10+lubuntu), but some windows update destroyed it. As I tried to restore the partitions, they could not be found by testdisk. So I tried to create a new MBR and a new partition table, but both failed. I don't care about the data but I would like to use the SSD again. Currently it seems that I cannot write a new partition table or a new MBR. GParted (run via UBCD) says "input/output error" when it tries to read the disk. Partition Wizard (Windows freeware). I'm willing to pay someone at least  in bitcoin for help with restoring a corrupt persistent partition on my Tails drive. The drive boots fine and the partition is recognized but data cannot be accessed after entering password. I am not a Linux guru, I just use Tails occasionally. Error message: “Error mounting /dev/dm-0 at /media/amnesia/TailsData: Command-line `mount -t "ext4" -o "uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid" "/dev/dm-0" "/media/amnesia/TailsData"' exited with non-zero exit status The HDD was the primary drive on my windows 10 (lots of family pictures that are not backed up :( ) and it failed somehow (i get an error of OS not found when I boot up). My 1.5yr old son has a tendency to sneak onto the computer and mash buttons and sometimes hit the power button - I wonder if he powered off the pc when it was writing data or something. I suspect it is a logic error, maybe a problem with teh boot sector. I do not hear any weird sounds or beeps when I boot up. It vibrates. I have been using my 8GB microsd card with my phone and link2sd in order to expand the storage, running google play services etc from the sd card. Unfortunately the other day it just stopped mounting, so reading up I thought the best thing to do is first try and get as much data off as possible with ddrescue and then use something like photorec or testdisk. The card is formatted into both fat32 and ext partitions - i think they are 6GB and 8GB respectively. I can't remember which version First off thank you for any help you can offer. Ok my external drive went kaputs a few days ago. It locked up windows (bad sectors it seams) and I did a hard restart on the computer and that buggered it it seams (oops). It is not making any strange sounds that I can hear. Its a Samsung external drive 2TB with a NTFS filesystem. Uh as for what its doing. it will lock up the bios if its active at boot but I can sometimes get it to kinda recognize in windows (as soon as I access I'm trying to recover files from a SSD that appears to have a corrupt sector from what I can tell (this is all very new to me). A few weeks ago my laptop began crashing. I suspect it was overheating. I had backed up files thanks to a friend's advice but I was in the middle of a large project and though I should have made another back up, I didn't. Then came the day when it crashed and I believe the last message I saw was Stop code: CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED. I was running Windows 10. The laptop. 
The problem in brief: My Windows partition suddenly won't mount in Linux Mint and trying to boot from it gives me “NTLDR is missing” I have run SMART, BIOS disk analysis, which told me no errors, and TestDisk, which suggested some problems with the NTFS file system (details below) I'm looking for guidance for my next steps and what tools I should use. SMART results: https://paste.rtechsupport.org/view/6a1f7304 (https://paste.rtechsupport.org/view/6a1f7304) My setup: Dual boot (GRUB. Hello, so I have quite the story. I have an old Dell Inspiron and figured I would install Ubuntu on it to learn a bit of Linux. It has an SSD as the boot drive and a HDD in the optical bay. After saving everything on the HDD I booted up from the Ubuntu boot flash drive and almost installed it but got cold feet when choosing drives - didn't want to accidentally format the wrong drive - so I quit the install before it wrote anything (or so I believed), turned off the machine and physically remove. Description of problem ================== A friend of the family asked if I would help her convert some VHS to DVD. Pretty simple, I have it running now, but without asking, she also brings a bunch of disks (which I have determined to be from their camcorder) and asked if I could convert them to DVD as well. Well, I said I'd try and took them. I popped on in and it registered as a burnable, blank DVD. Hm. I looked in ISOBuster, and there appears to be over a gig and a half of information Disclaimer 1 : Simple amp best answer : Having backups. Yes I blamed myself, but well shit happens, now I have setup backup. Disclaimer 2: This procedure worked for me , please dont blindly copy/paste commands, try to understand them. Disclaimer 3: I can't be responsible for any more data loss. I mean we have already lost some of them, let's not make it worse. Ok, let's try to recover them now! Note that all happened because of my negligence, I thought I was backuping Hey guys, I have dropped my external drive during a backup procedure 5 years ago. I plugged the drive out, putted it away and cried a lot for a few weeks. Today I found the drive again and started to boo it. I used the bare drive to connect it via and external adapter to the PC and it showed up on the Workspace. The drive runs smooth and does not make any noises. Unfortunately the drive isn't shown with a name and has a capacity of 0 bytes. It also slows the whole system down. I have checked. initial situation: GigaByte XHD Mainboard raid-5 3x3TB 64k stripes one partition encrypted with veracrypt. Strange software behaviours: Sometimes one of the hdds doesn't get recognized at startup so the raid switches to degraded and after a reboot the "missing" disk is back again and gets rebuilt automatically in the background even if that technically isn't necessary. Another very rare phenomenon is that one of the hdds in my raid just disappears out of the raid because it appears. 
Recently I had one of my 4TB WD Black's I got about when 4TB drives first came available throw an error in Windows 7. It said something along the lines of "There was a problem detected with DriveLetter: Please backup all of your data". I began copying the data to another drive and within 5 minutes or so, I got another message that was just along the lines of "DriveLetter: has failed". I removed the drive and attached it using a USBlt-gtSATA adapter. The drive was detected and I could still. Hey all, I am new here. I'd consider myself a beginner as a user. I have looked into my problem and honestly most of the forum responses I've fished up just confuse me. So I have this HP Simple Save md1000h, it's a Terabyte in size and it's served me faithfully. until today. I am running it on a Dell Inspirion 5559 with Windows 10 64-bit. Processor: Core i5-6200U @2.30GHz Nothing happened to this HPSS. It wasn't dropped or gotten wet or anything. It's sitting safely on my desk as always. Hello, Recently, I got a weird error on my USB and then the whole unit went missing. I can't seem to detect it at all. When I plug it in, and check disk management, all I see is "Disk 1, Removable (E:), No media." It does not have a unallocated bar or anything. List of methods I tried so far when my USB went down: Testdisk - didn't detect anything, everything was read as bad sector. I tried fixing the boot sector, but it didn't give me any messages or anything when it finished and i still. First of all my PC specs: Windows 10 Professional 64-bit MSI Krait Z170A Intel i7-6700K MSI Radeon R9 390X 16 GB Patriot Viper 4 2400 MHz Kingston SSDNow 300 2 x WD Blue 1 TB (WD10EZEX) -gt One of these are the culprit ----------------------------------------------------- So here's the problem, when the specific WD Blue hard drive is plugged in through a SATA port, windows hangs at the blue windows logo and does not load, even when left on overnight.
