I found this guide from Digital Ocean on how to set it up with an SSL certificate you generate yourself, but would rather have it go through LetsEncrypt You will need to customize your build to suit your needs, but I picked wallets of the major currencies.

So i sat down and wrote a couple of things down, which should/could be improved. some should not perhaps, but alas, my company would like to have it. Disclaimer: I work with mostly FLOSS-components, so i know everything a little bit, but most of it not very good. If sth. is already done, i missed it. But i do not think that i missed much.
