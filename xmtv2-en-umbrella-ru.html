                            <p>Hey guys, I started noticing some of you guys are PMing me more and more often regarding Monaco and the tickets/grandstands for the F1 GP therefore I decided to write up some lines that I hope may help you in your choice. For an optimal viewing experience of this post I recommend you downloading the free Chrome or Firefox extension Imagus . Notice I am in no way affiliated to F1 or any ticketing site anymore therefore you won’t find any affiliate links or referrals or whatever. ##I found 83 Hitlers in r/Politics today. #####William Barr: is his defence of Trump paving the road to tyranny? - "Mussolini seems like a more likely outcome than Hitler."

Respect Firestorm (https://imgur.com/a/M9Rpyap) Overview (/highlight) Formed during an accidental nuclear meltdown, Martin Stein and Ronnie Raymond would form into a composite being known as Firestorm. Firestorm would go through multiple changes, with a number of people being added to and removed from the matrix.

So, yesterday it seems that people liked the story of Napoli and Genoa (https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/75w9ii/scenes_from_napoli_and_genoa_facing_each_other/) getting promoted togheter, so i tought i could share another story. This one is not wholesome like the previous one, in fact it's a tragic story with a tragic end. It's a bit long story, but it's worth it. We are talking about the " Derby del Sole (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby_del_Sole)" (Derby This started out as a way to torture myself and eventually turned into something that could be helpful. I'll make a few notes before the list, feel free to skip this part: 1. I wouldn't recommend memorizing this list, and making them into flashcards or something is just about the worst thing you could do. Instead, do untimed 3BLD solves and try to come up with letter pairs of your own, and if you can't, refer to a list. (Like this one!) 2. A lot of these images are sexual, primarily because. TLDR: gt Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Medvedev talked about Facebook’s role in politics, though only jokingly in reference to its importance in the American presidential campaign, according to Mr. Medvedev’s press office. https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/technology/zuckerberg-meets-with-medvedev-in-key-market.html Russia is embedded into Facebook gt Yuri Milner’s DST’s first investors included Goldman Sachs and American hedge fund Tiger Global.

#Revisiting the Northern Naval UCAV Ecosystem ##Filling the Capability Gap: Take Two With the reevaluation of the role of AI systems and proper limits placed on autonomous behaviour of the various components after last year’s disaster (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/8f4z38/secret_textron_mq36_egret_unmanned_combat_aerial/), Textron has restarted its attempt to fill the capability gap left by the absence of the UAT-6B Timber Wolf (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpower. Anyone like lots of matchup charts? Apparently lots of people do, because I see a lot of people use these as a resource. It's long past overdue I gave this a big update, and though I bet some stuff has slipped between the cracks \(particularly Japanese players who are a lot more difficult to search for charts from\), here goes nothing. Please let me know if there are any things I should add or fix. What is a notable player? I originally chose the word notable to avoid any semantics. NEW VERSION: V7! (https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/7b0tx4/notable_players_matchup_chart_compilation_v7/) Been a while, hasn't it. I'd say I was waiting for lots of charts but in reality I'm just lazy. As with before, let me know if there's any charts I'm missing, if you have some relevant credentials and a chart to add, or any other miscellaneous things.

Figured I'd give this a major update with all the charts I've found recently, so here's version 2. If there's any 1.1.5 or 1.1.6 charts I'm missing that aren't previous versions of ones here, please let me know. Translations of some of the Japanese ones would be helpful too. So, without further adieu, here are all the charts I've collected: Diddy Kong Zinoto (https://twitter.com/Zinoto/status/755528897828098049) + !

There were eight people in a row on the front row who all but one wore apparently homemade t-shirts which said something on them. I could only make out "Minako" at the start. They were all hilariously into it :D Basically, imagine Yuuma Uchida at Anisama (https://streamable.com/immib) but eight of them. They didn't. So I've noticed ALOT of threads of folks asking what games they should play before RE7. To narrow down the repeated threads I though I'd try to held by making a quick list and the best platforms to currently play them on to help. The first list will be the main story, cutting out the fat and just the main story. Resident Evil Remake. PS4,Xboxone,PC. Resident Evil Zero  PS4,Xboxone,PC. Resident Evil 2. PS3, PC Resident Evil 3. PS3,PC Resident Evil Code: Veronic. Here we go again! Guess I'll just update this every month or so idk with all the new/updated charts I see (there were a ton of updated ones). Also, I finally got around to alphabetizing the characters. As with before, if there's any 1.1.5 or 1.1.6 charts I'm missing that aren't previous versions of ones here, please let me know. If you think your chart belongs up here, I'm pretty loose on what 'notable' is, so if you like, did reasonably well at a major tournament (Say like, top 96 at a supermaj. Outdated ; new one can be found here (https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/5q0erf/notable_players_matchup_chart_compilation_v5/). Well, guess it's that time of the month again. Same story as always, a fair amount of new charts or charts that I've found since last time.

What is BOINC? It's short for Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing. It's an open-source middleware system for volunteer computing. Think of Folding@Home as a single project. BOINC is a collection of projects (Folding used to be under the BOINC umbrella!). BOINC can be run on a wide variety of hardware. Everything from Raspberry Pi to Android, Windows, Mac, Linux, CPUs and GPUs! There's quite a number of BOINC projects out there. Everything from mathematics to biology and in-be. Yeah, this again. Helpful resource for me to have around and I'm sure it's a helpful resource for others too. As with before, let me know if there's any charts I'm missing, if you have relevant credentials and a chart to add, or any other miscellaneous information I should know.

This is my first self-post. To ~~celebrate the magic~~ start, I will be posting stuff from my resource hunt -- this is where I go to Disney-related websites and extract image URLs that are somewhat inaccessible to the public. I hope that you guys get some benefits from my resource hunt, say if you found inspiration in some posters, will make a background of them as your wallpaper, use a few for your next Photoshop project, or enjoyed browsing through Frozen-related content. As always, we encourage participation from everyone - if you've never heard the album, there's a YouTube link provided! Go check it out and report back!
